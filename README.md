Wetlands Detection

Wetland detection model:

1. **Data Preprocessing Notebook**
   - * This notebook guides users through the process of preprocessing wetland data, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation. Users will learn techniques for handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for model training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebook**
   - In this notebook, users will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the preprocessed wetland dataset. They will visualize key relationships, distributions, and patterns within the data to gain insights into the characteristics of wetland areas. This notebook also covers statistical analysis techniques to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations.

3. **Model Training Notebook**
   - This notebook focuses on training machine learning models for wetland detection. Users will learn to implement various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The notebook provides guidance on model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics to ensure optimal performance.

4. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation Notebook**
   -  In this notebook, users will evaluate the performance of trained wetland detection models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. They will also learn techniques for model interpretation, including feature importance analysis and model visualization, to gain insights into the factors driving wetland detection.

5. **Deployment and Application Notebook**
   - This notebook covers the deployment and application of wetland detection models in real-world scenarios. Users will learn how to deploy trained models as web applications or APIs using frameworks like Shiny and Flask. Additionally, the notebook demonstrates how to apply the models to new data for wetland mapping and monitoring tasks.

We hope to provide a comprehensive guide for users to build, evaluate, and deploy wetland detection models using R. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the modeling process, allowing users to follow a structured approach from data preprocessing to model deployment.
